 * Breaking it down:
 *   #!          - The shebang marker (must be the very first two characters)
 *   /usr/bin/env - A program that finds other programs in your PATH
 *   gjs         - The interpreter we want to use (GNOME JavaScript)
 *
 * Why use "/usr/bin/env gjs" instead of just "/usr/bin/gjs"?
 *   - Different systems install gjs in different locations
 *   - "env" searches your PATH to find wherever gjs is installed
 *   - This makes the script more portable across different systems
 *
 * With this shebang, you can run the file directly:

/**

 *                            THE GTK DEMO
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Welcome! This is a heavily commented demo of a GTK4 application written in
 * JavaScript (GJS). Think of it as a guided tour through building a GUI app.
 *
 * This demo app does ONE thing: it lets you type text into an input field,
 * click a button, and see that text displayed on screen. Simple, right?
 * But along the way, you'll learn about:
 *
 *   - GTK widgets (buttons, input fields, labels)
 *   - Event handling (what happens when you click that button?)
 *   - Layout management (how do we arrange things on screen?)
 *   - The GObject type system (how GTK organizes objects)
 *
 * Let's get started!
 */

/**
 * ============================================================================
 *                                 IMPORTS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Before we can use GTK, we need to import it. GJS (GNOME JavaScript) uses
 * a special imports system to load native libraries.
 *
 * Think of this like "import" in Node.js or Python, but for GNOME libraries.
 */

// First, we tell GJS which versions of these libraries we want.
// This prevents compatibility issues if multiple versions are installed.
imports.gi.versions.Gtk = '4.0';    // We want GTK version 4
imports.gi.versions.Adw = '1';      // We want libadwaita version 1

// Now we import the actual libraries and destructure the objects we need.
// "gi" stands for "GObject Introspection" - it's the magic that lets
// JavaScript talk to C libraries like GTK.
const { Gtk, Gio, Adw, GObject } = imports.gi;

// Let's break down what each import does:
//
//   Gtk     - The GTK toolkit. This gives us buttons, windows, labels, etc.
//   Gio     - GNOME Input/Output. Handles files, apps, and async operations.
//   Adw     - Libadwaita. Modern GNOME app patterns and widgets.
//   GObject - The object system that underlies all GNOME libraries.

 * identify your app, manage its windows, and handle settings.
 *
 * The format is reverse-domain notation, like Java packages.

 *   - Add more buttons that do different things
 *   - Change the styling with CSS
 *   - Add keyboard shortcuts
 *   - Make the input field multi-line (use Gtk.TextView instead)
 *   - Add an icon or image
